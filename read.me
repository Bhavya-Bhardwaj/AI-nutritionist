# Gemini Health App

The **Gemini Health App** is an innovative web application developed using Streamlit that leverages Google's Generative AI (Gemini) to analyze food images and provide nutritional information. The app calculates the total calories of food items in the image and provides detailed calorie intake information for each food item.
